    At the age of eighteen he was active with the Vlaams Schouwtoneel with which he made a tour to the Belgian Congo in 1958. 
    Pauwels graduated magna cum laude from the Herman Teirlinck Studio and in 1963 was associated with the K.N.S. 
    and later the Royal Youth Theatre. Ivo also played in productions of Het Fakkel Theater, EWT, Arca and the Zwarte Komedie. 
    Meanwhile, together with Ruud de Ridder, Ivo had founded the Echt Antwaarps Teater. 
    His best-known role is that of Nonkel Jef Melkenbeek, the stingy and headstrong farmer in the sitcom Nonkel Jef. 
    After a long period out of character, he made his comeback as nonkel Jef in Sven de Ridder's theatre piece "op bezoek bij de scouts".
