    Jan Amanda Gustaaf Decleir is a Belgian actor. Decleir is a stage actor, but as a film actor he has reached a larger audience and world fame.
    Decleir studied for several years at the Herman Teirlinckn Studio, where he also took the lead a few years later with Ivo Pauwels. 
    He renewed the renowned drama school and brought in many new teachers: actors from the Blauwe Maandag Compagnie, STAN and others. 
    He could not prevent the school from being hampered by ever new austerity measures.
