<h1>Hollywood</h1>
<p>
    The term Hollywood is also used to refer to the film industry in and around Hollywood. 
    The first studio was founded in 1911 by David Horsley of the Nestor Company. 
    In the same year, 15 more independent studios were established. 
    Film production companies flocked to Hollywood for its good weather and longer days. 
    In the early days of film, strong artificial lighting was not yet possible; the only light source that provided sufficient illumination for the film was the sun. 
    Until then, New York had been the capital of film production.
