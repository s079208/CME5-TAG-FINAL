<h1>Gert Late Night</h1>


<a href="home.html" class="homebutton"><img src="img/home.png" alt="home"></a> 

<p>
    The programme is presented by Gert Verhulst from his own boat, the Evanna. The sidekick on duty is James Cooke. 
    Every week, three well-known Flemings (or well-known Dutchmen) spend three nights on the boat. 
    During an episode, which lasts just under an hour, 
    current affairs are discussed and several other guests are invited.
    In between episodes, the programme is enlivened and made more light-hearted by short fragments of the guests on the boat, 
    for example, a film of the breakfast that day, and short reports.
